# Description
This project is a light prototype to demonstrate the 
Intuit [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) test harness.

# Usage
This project requires Gradle to build and test.

* `gradle test`

# Features
The `Runner.java` class introduced the necessary connection with
JUnit to discover and run all `.feature` test files down the 
folder hierarchy.

There are ways to isolate and run specific features that will be 
added later (or read the docs).
